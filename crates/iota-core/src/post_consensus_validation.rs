//! Post-consensus validation and owned-object conflict resolution for
//! `UserTransactionV1` transactions.
//!
//! This module merges two formerly separate pipeline stages into a single pass:
//!
//! 1. **Semantic validation** — deduplication, already-executed check,
//!    structural validity, and deny checks (deny lists, gas, ownership, coin
//!    deny list, Move authenticator).
//! 2. **Owned-object conflict resolution** (white-flag) — three-tier lock check
//!    and lock acquisition.
//!
//! Processing both in one loop avoids iterating over every transaction twice
//! and skips expensive validation for transactions that can't acquire object
//! locks anyway.
//!
//! # Per-transaction order within the loop
//!
//! 1. Non-`UserTransactionV1` — pass through unchanged.
//! 2. Dedup by `ConsensusTransactionKey` — silent drop.
//! 3. Already executed — **retained** as a committee-agreed winner (registers
//!    its locks, skips re-validation); not dropped. See issue #11649.
//! 4. `validity_check()` — drop with error.
//! 5. Three-tier lock conflict check (local HashMap → quarantine → DB) — drop
//!    with error, except a lock held by the same transaction (a deferred tx's
//!    own prior-round lock), which is exempt. Cheap; performed before expensive
//!    checks.
//! 6. `handle_transaction_validation_checks()` — drop with error. Only reached
//!    when all locks are free.
//! 7. All passed — acquire locks in the local tracking map, keep transaction.
//!
//! Non-`UserTransactionV1` transactions pass through unchanged.

/// For each `UserTransactionV1` in consensus order:
/// - Runs deduplication, structural validity, lock conflict check, and deny
///   checks (deny list, gas, ownership, coin deny list, Move authenticator).
/// - If all checks pass, acquires owned-object locks in a local tracking map.
/// - Drops the transaction (with an error) on any failure.
