//! End-to-end characterization tests for the P-COOL (certificate-less /
//! post-consensus owned-object locking) transaction flow.
//!
//! They cover the two subsystems that cooperate after consensus, end-to-end and
//! through the production RPC path:
//!
//! 1. **P-COOL post-consensus conflict resolution** — owned-object transactions
//!    flow through consensus and the "first writer in consensus order wins"
//!    rule is applied after ordering (`post_consensus_validation.rs`).
//! 2. **The execution scheduler** — survivors are enqueued and driven to
//!    execution / finality.
//!
//! Assertions are deliberately **black-box** (finality and execution status
//! only), so the same scenario is valid against either scheduler
//! implementation. Each scenario therefore runs twice: once against the legacy
//! `TransactionManager` and once against the new `ExecutionScheduler`, with
//! `assert_scheduler` confirming which one is actually in effect on the
//! fullnode.
//!
//! ## Why `#[cfg(msim)]`
//!
//! P-COOL is enabled with a protocol-config override, which is
//! **thread-local**. The validator/fullnode nodes only observe it when they run
//! on the test's OS thread — true under the `msim` simulator (it schedules
//! every node on the calling thread), but not under plain multi-threaded tokio,
//! where `iota-swarm` spawns each node on its own thread and the flag would
//! silently be `false`. So they are gated to the simulator, and
//! `assert_pcool_active` additionally fails loudly if the flag is not in effect
//! on the fullnode.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo simtest -p iota-e2e-tests test_pcool`.
//!
//! Under `enable_pcool_flow`, `ValidatorService::handle_transaction` is
//! disabled, so transactions must be submitted via the fullnode RPC path
//! (`TransactionDriver`), which is what
//! `WalletContext::execute_transaction_may_fail` uses.
