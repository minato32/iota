"""Aggregate H1 raw timeseries across multiple runs into a V1-vs-V2 summary.

Percentiles are computed by POOLING the raw histogram buckets across runs — the
statistically correct way to combine percentiles (you cannot average per-run
quantiles). Throughput and CPU are averaged across runs. With a single run per
group, the result matches the per-run scalar summary.

Usage: h1-aggregate.py <results_dir> [out.md]
  Scans <results_dir>/*/run-a-v1-timeseries.json   (V1, attestation OFF)
    and <results_dir>/*/run-b-v2-timeseries.json   (V2, attestation ON)
