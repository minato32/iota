"""dump_timeseries.py — scrape one run window from Prometheus into a raw JSON.

Stores the underlying series verbatim — cumulative histogram buckets
(+ _count/_sum) and raw counters/gauges — with NO rate()/histogram_quantile()/
aggregation baked in. Everything (any rate window, any quantile, per-validator
breakdowns, correct cross-run aggregation by pooling raw histograms) is
reconstructed from this offline by aggregate.py / plot.py. Each entry is the raw
query_range result: one series per full label set (le, host, name, …),
values = [[ts, "v"], …].

Pure stdlib (urllib/json) — runs on system python3, no venv.

Usage:  dump_timeseries.py <label> <start_epoch> <end_epoch> <step_s> <out.json>
Env:    PROM (Prometheus base URL), CFG_* (recorded under "config" in the JSON
        so the aggregator can flag pooling across mismatched configs).

Standalone use (e.g. re-scrape a past window without re-running the experiment):
  PROM=http://localhost:9090 CFG_workload=owned \
    python3 dump_timeseries.py mylabel 1781770000 1781770030 1 /tmp/out.json
